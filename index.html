		<h1>Metaballs</h1>
		<h3>by Ian Moses</h3>
		<p>This is my attempt at creating metaballs.</p>

		<p>The purpose of this project is more for me to learn how shaders work than anything else. I especially wanted to learn how to blend shaders into p5. I know that metaballs can be easily done with just shaders, so I made this one stateful so that the shaders lay on top of the underlying data. In mine, the metaballs follow the n-body problem. I based all of the shader, metaball, and n-body stuff off of The Coding Train.</p>

		<p>I also used a video from Zach Star showing how logistic growth works to limit the speed of the metaballs. It adds a really nice subtle soft cap to the speed of the balls, stopping them from veering out of control.</p>
